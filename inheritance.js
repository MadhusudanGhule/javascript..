// Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows classes to inherit properties and methods from other classes. It enables code reuse, promotes modularity, and establishes hierarchical relationships between classes. Inheritance can be classified into several types, including:

// 1. Single Inheritance:
//    Single inheritance refers to a relationship where a class inherits properties and methods from a single superclass or parent class. In this type of inheritance, a derived class (also known as a subclass or child class) extends a single base class. The derived class inherits all the accessible members (attributes and methods) of the base class.

// 2. Multiple Inheritance:
//    Multiple inheritance is a type of inheritance where a class can inherit properties and methods from multiple parent classes. In this approach, a derived class can extend more than one base class. However, multiple inheritance can lead to ambiguity and complexity, as conflicts may arise when two or more parent classes define members with the same name.

// 3. Multilevel Inheritance:
//    Multilevel inheritance involves a chain of inheritance, where a derived class inherits from another derived class. In this type of inheritance, a class serves as both a base class for one class and a derived class for another class. It establishes a hierarchical relationship, allowing classes to inherit properties and behaviors at multiple levels.

// 4. Hierarchical Inheritance:
//    Hierarchical inheritance occurs when multiple derived classes inherit from a single base class. In this type of inheritance, one base class is extended by multiple child classes. Each child class inherits the properties and methods of the base class and can have additional members specific to its own functionality.

// 5. Hybrid Inheritance:
//    Hybrid inheritance is a combination of multiple types of inheritance. It involves combining two or more types of inheritance, such as single inheritance, multiple inheritance, or multilevel inheritance, to form a hybrid inheritance hierarchy. This allows for more complex class relationships and code reuse scenarios.

// It's important to note that the exact types and features of inheritance can vary depending on the programming language or OOP framework being used. Some languages may not support multiple inheritance due to potential conflicts, while others may provide alternative mechanisms like interfaces or mixins to achieve similar functionality.

// Inheritance is a powerful mechanism that enables the creation of class hierarchies, promotes code reuse, and enhances the structure and organization of object-oriented systems. Careful consideration should be given to the design and use of inheritance relationships to ensure proper encapsulation, maintainability, and flexibility within the codebase.
